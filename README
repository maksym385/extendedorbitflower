Extended Orbitflower Model

This project extends the Orbitflower model developed by Kriglstein and Mangler to support editing and mock integration with the CPEE (Cloud Process Execution Engine).


Features:
- Add, edit, and remove organizational elements (units, roles, subjects)
- Build subject selection queries using the query builder
- Selections retrievable though URL encoding

How to Run:
1. Ensure Ruby is installed.
2. Install required gems:
   gem install sinatra
   gem install nokogiri
3. From the project directory, run:
   ruby server.rb
4. Open in your browser:
   http://localhost:4567/mock
5. Access the visualization through the Button

Note:
- Integration with the CPEE is mocked.
- Developed as part of an academic thesis.
- The organizational XML has been anonymized
